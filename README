# svn-change-author

This is a small script to change the author of svn commits already made.
My usage for this came up when the username format changed at work and
we still wanted to be able to track all the old commits and statistics
on a per-author basis.

Usage:

To change the commits done by user "daniel.liljeberg" to "dli" do the following in your checked out folder

$ ./svn-rename-author daniel.liljeberg dli
 
Make sure that you have pre-revprop-change hook enabled for svn:author on the server

You are free to use and modify this script as long as you credit me and
make your changes avalible to the public.
